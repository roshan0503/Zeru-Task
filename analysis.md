# Aave V2 Wallet Credit Score Analysis

This document provides an in-depth analysis of the credit scores assigned to Aave V2 wallets, based on their historical transaction behavior. The analysis aims to understand the distribution of scores and characterize the typical behavior of wallets falling into different score ranges.

## 1. Credit Score Distribution

The credit scores are designed to range from 0 to 1000. A higher score indicates more responsible and reliable usage of the Aave V2 protocol, while a lower score suggests risky or potentially bot-like behavior.

### Overall Distribution

The histogram below illustrates the overall distribution of credit scores across all analyzed wallets. This helps in understanding the general scoring pattern â€“ whether scores are clustered, skewed, or evenly distributed.

*This graph would show a histogram of credit scores, likely indicating a central tendency and the spread of scores. Depending on the dataset, it might show a normal distribution or a skew towards higher/lower scores.*

### Wallets by Score Range

To further understand the score distribution, wallets are categorized into 100-point ranges. This bar chart provides a clear view of how many wallets fall into each segment, allowing for easy identification of the most common score brackets.

*This graph would display a bar chart showing the count of wallets within specific score ranges (e.g., 0-100, 101-200, ..., 901-1000). This helps in identifying the density of wallets at different credit levels.*

### Score Distribution by Liquidation Status

A critical indicator of risk is whether a wallet has undergone a liquidation. This comparison highlights how credit scores differ between wallets that have been liquidated and those that have not, validating the model's ability to identify risky behavior.

*This graph would compare the credit score distributions for wallets that have experienced liquidation versus those that have not. It is expected that liquidated wallets would generally have lower credit scores, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in capturing this risk factor.*

### Key Feature Correlations with Credit Score

Understanding which features most strongly correlate with the credit score provides insights into the drivers of the scoring model. Positive correlations indicate features that contribute to higher scores, while negative correlations suggest features associated with lower scores.

*This graph would show a bar chart of the correlation coefficients between key engineered features (e.g., repay_to_borrow_ratio, was_liquidated, activity_duration_days, borrow_to_deposit_ratio, timing_regularity) and the final credit_score. For instance, repay_to_borrow_ratio is expected to have a strong positive correlation, while was_liquidated and borrow_to_deposit_ratio are expected to have strong negative correlations.*

## 2. Behavior of Wallets in Different Score Ranges

Based on the feature engineering and scoring logic implemented in `app.py`, we can infer the typical behaviors associated with different credit score ranges.

### Wallets in the Lower Range (e.g., 0-400)

Wallets with lower credit scores typically exhibit behaviors indicative of higher risk, less responsible usage, or potentially automated/exploitative activities. Key characteristics include:

**High Liquidation Incidence:** A significant portion of wallets in this range will have experienced at least one `liquidationcall`. This is a strong negative indicator, heavily penalized by the scoring model.

**Low Repay-to-Borrow Ratio:** These wallets often borrow without consistently repaying, or their repayment volume is significantly lower than their borrowing volume.

**High Borrow-to-Deposit Ratio:** They tend to borrow a large amount relative to their deposits, indicating aggressive leverage or insufficient collateral.

**Short Activity Duration:** Many low-scoring wallets might be newly active or have very short periods of engagement, suggesting quick in-and-out strategies.

**High Timing Regularity (Bot-like Behavior):** A very consistent and predictable timing between transactions can suggest automated or bot-like activity, which is often associated with less organic and potentially exploitative strategies in DeFi.

**Lower Transaction Volume:** Some low-scoring wallets might have very few transactions, making it difficult to assess responsible behavior.

These behaviors collectively suggest a higher risk profile, where users are either less diligent in managing their positions, engaging in speculative high-leverage trades, or operating automated scripts that might not prioritize long-term protocol health.

### Wallets in the Higher Range (e.g., 800-1000)

Wallets with higher credit scores demonstrate responsible, consistent, and diversified engagement with the Aave V2 protocol. Their characteristics include:

**No or Very Few Liquidations:** High-scoring wallets are highly unlikely to have been liquidated, indicating effective risk management and timely collateralization/repayment.

**High Repay-to-Borrow Ratio:** These wallets consistently repay their loans, often with a high ratio of repayment volume to borrowing volume, showcasing financial discipline.

**Consistent Deposit and Repayment Activity:** Regular deposits and repayments contribute positively, indicating active and healthy participation.

**Longer Activity Duration:** Wallets with high scores often have a prolonged history of interaction with the protocol, demonstrating sustained engagement and commitment.

**Portfolio Diversification:** Interaction with a variety of assets (higher `unique_assets`) suggests a more diversified and less speculative approach.

**Lower Timing Regularity:** More human-like, less predictable transaction timing, indicating organic interaction rather than automated scripts.

**Higher Overall Transaction Volume:** While not a direct scoring factor, generally, more active and responsible wallets will have a higher total number of transactions.

These behaviors collectively represent a low-risk profile, indicating users who are reliable, manage their finances prudently, and contribute positively to the liquidity and stability of the Aave V2 ecosystem.

## 3. Limitations and Future Work

**Data Scope:** The model is trained solely on transaction behavior within Aave V2. Incorporating data from other DeFi protocols (e.g., Uniswap, Compound) could provide a more holistic view of a wallet's on-chain activity.

**External Factors:** The current model does not consider off-chain data or broader market conditions, which can influence wallet behavior.

**Dynamic Weighting:** The current feature weights are fixed. Future iterations could explore dynamic weighting based on machine learning models (e.g., regression, neural networks) that learn optimal weights from labeled data (if available).

**Time-Series Modeling:** More advanced time-series analysis could capture evolving behavioral patterns and predict future risk more accurately.

**Edge Cases:** Further analysis is needed to fine-tune the scoring for edge cases, such as very new wallets with limited transaction history.

This analysis provides a foundational understanding of Aave V2 wallet creditworthiness based on on-chain behavior. The insights gained can be valuable for risk assessment, user segmentation, and potentially for designing tailored incentives within the DeFi ecosystem.
